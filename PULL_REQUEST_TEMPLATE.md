Please use the following structure when proposing changes to our shared Vim configuration and make sure to complete the checklist at the end.

# What

Summarize your change.

_Example: Specify full path when running focused specs._

# Why

Summarize the motivation for the change (bug, feature, etc.)

_Example: When only a relative path is specified, focused specs don't run if the shell's current working directory differs from the project root._

# Checklist

- [ ] Send RFC email to Braintree developers _if change may be impactful_. Please include a link to this PR so that disucssion about the pros and cons of the change remains linked to the proposed changes. **Recent examples include**: addition of linter and completer, no longer removing end-of-line whitespace on save, changing to fzf for file lookup.
